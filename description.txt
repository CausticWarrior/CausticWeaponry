Caustic Weaponry is a small mod now, but plans to rework how players play and view terraria with a focus on quality over quantity. 
Do not be mistaken, Caustic Weaponry will sill eventually add a slew of items for every class, and maybe even a class of its own!
Right now the mod only adds:

12 Items
1 Material
10 NPCs
9 Buffs
1 Minion
1 Pet

Future plans for the mod:

5-7 new ores with their own tools and focuses
3+ new bosses
20+ new NPCs
4+ Town NPCs
150+ Unique and interesting items
20+ potions
